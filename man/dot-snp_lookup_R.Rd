\usage{
.snp_lookup_R(
  pairs,
  snps_ext_by_leaf = NULL,
  snps_bg_by_leaf = NULL,
  snps_all_by_leaf = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairs}{data.frame/data.table with columns Tree (0-based) and leaf_id (native)}

\item{snps_ext_by_leaf}{list-of-lists mapping tree -> leaf_id -> integer SNP indices (or NULL)}

\item{snps_bg_by_leaf}{list-of-lists mapping tree -> leaf_id -> integer SNP indices (or NULL)}

\item{snps_all_by_leaf}{list-of-lists mapping tree -> leaf_id -> integer SNP indices (or NULL)}
}
\value{
list(bucket_ext, bucket_bg, bucket_all)
}
\description{
Given a data.table/data.frame of (Tree, leaf_id) pairs, return the unique SNP
indices captured by those leaves, optionally split into extreme/background/all
universes depending on which lookup maps are provided.
